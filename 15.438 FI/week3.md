duration of IG credit index is near all time high
# Convexity and its properties
Calculating convexity: second derivative

convexity increases with squared maturity - duration is linear
duration approximation: slide along the tangent line
convexity is positive, a increase in rate -> duration decrease the price and convexity increase the price

negative convexity: second order reinforces first order change ...

dP / P = -D_M* dy + 1/2 C * (dy)^2

# Bullet and Barbell
Bullet: single payment?
Barbell: cash flows spaced in time

Bullets have a smaller convexity than barbells: barbells are better than bullets

portfolio manager is expected to do better if rates change with the barbell portfolio

think about two convex graph that tangent to each other at a point... any change makes barbell better!

# Immunization
"cash matching" + duration matching

use 20-year 7% coupon bond to immunize 10-year zero coupon 

reimmunize: sell the bond, rebalance to have a portfolio with new duration

# Delta and Gamma Hedging
Delta neutral: dollar duration of asset = liability
Gamma neutral: equates 

3 yr or 10 yr more convex? 10 yr, for the quadratic rule
If hedge - prefer the 3 yr
If long - prefer the 10 yr

immunization vs delta hedging: immunization includes PV matching


# The treasury market
$21.7 trillion public +  $6.1 trillion intragovernmental

Growth of fed balance sheet: growing to lower interest rate

fed: borrow short term and lend long term, carry, regard as profit?
