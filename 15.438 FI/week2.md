India: financial policy(central bank) has been surbodinated to fiscal policy: subject to popularist policy of government

market interpretation of inflation: hyping for weeks

# Risk in the fixed income marketplace
interest rate risk
- price risk: uncertainty about bond prices at the time of sale
- reinvestment risk: uncertain investment rate on coupon income

"risk" uncertainty associated with the return on an investment

# Total Return Analysis
"horizon return" / realized compound yield
future value experimenting with different interest rate changes

interest on interst, future value of coupon interst using annuity, ...

# Floating Rate Bounds
1-year libor + 1%(credit spread)
floating rate price: more stable? coupon payment is adjusted to market situation, so the price will be less affected

if no spread: priced at par at reset dates!

# Yield Curve/Term Structure
rate of return as a function of time to maturity
"spot" or "zero" yield curve

The yield curve: for gov securities

yield to maturity: assume every year rate is the same and then backward solve from price, page 

# Topic 2: conceptual goals for this topic
duration and convexity (basic nad more advanced definitions)
delta/gamma hedge?
# Duration
p = f(y;other factors)
duration = partial f / partial y
convexity: second 

short-term yield more volatile than long-term

## fators affecing duration
remaining maturity: higher coupon, higher duration
coupon rate: higher coupon, lower duration
level of interest rate
credit risk, attched options

## Conceptual Definitions
Primary: duration is the elasticity of bond prices with respect to changes in yield
secondary: duration is the holding period horizon at which price risk and reinvestment risk approximately cancel

## Macauley 
D = (-dP/dY) * (1/P) *(1+Y/k)
third term: 1 + coupon rate 
derivation: simple taking derivative of Price
weighted average time

D = (1/k) * PVCF1 / PVTCF + (2/k) *PVCF2 / PVTCF ...
think about 1/k as "1/k yr away from first payment"...

For zero coupon option-free bond: duration = maturity

## Modified Duration
dPB / pB = MD
MD = D / (1+Y/k)

Duration is only good for small price change: 

## Dollar Duration
Dd = DM * Price
Portfolio duration: sum of dollar duration, weighted of modified duration

# LImitation of DUration measures
assume flat yield curve/parralel shifts
steepness/curvature shifts

# GEneralized Measures of Duration
total change in bond price as sum of partial effects
total derivative
??? factors are rates along the yiled curve? key rate durations?
## effective duration
true price sensitivity of the sucurity to changes in yield
from data?
smaller than modified duration when the cash flows are regarded as certain
# Interpretation of duration as a break even point for future value
accumulated value: reinvest coupon proceeds, plus liquidate (sell bond) value
start with 7%, if right after you buy rate > 4% and stay there
duration: the time that the accumulated value is about the same
