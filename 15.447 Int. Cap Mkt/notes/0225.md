# Balance of Payments Accounting
Trade deficit or surplus

capital flows - trade flows linked, either direction
interest rate: internal rate of return, costs of borrowing, alternative investment opportunities


## CA: Current Account
NX = X - M, net exports, trade balance
includes but relatively small:
1. Investment Income Account: considers dividends, interest, de/appreciation, wages
2. Unilateral transfers from abroad: sending back to family country

180 billion deficit in 2020 quarter 3, 
## FA: capital and financial account
net decrease in domestic ownership of foreign assets (sell -> increase in FA)
net change in foreign ownership of domestic assets

In theory CA+FA = 0

220 billion FA (net capital inflow to) US]

trade deficit: borrowing
why capital dont flow to less developed countries to help them grow?
