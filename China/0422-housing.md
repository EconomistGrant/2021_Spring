1. stop blaming china for starting covid-19. 
2. instead of only blaming trump for false practices, recognizing china's practice as well
3. direct the public and international focus to the vaccines, propagate advantages, and initiate/lead program to manufacture and distribute vaccines all over the world, just as the rebuild period after WWII
