# Agenda
Trade war discussion
US perspective
extension from trade war to tech: huawei
wrap up 
Chinese perspective

no biden perspective so far

# Reasons for Trump to launch trade war
trade deficit: is trade the reason? different economic status, us customers buy a lot, so more imports; china saves a lot
should US care? China or Vietnam as deficit? partners?

tech: IP theft, IP transfer
valuation: extremely hard

Market: unequal market access; rule of competition, subsidies, devalue CNY(it is appreciating for years since 15)

politics: MAGA 

China Retaliations:
tariff on US agriculture, harm trump

# Huawei
private companyu but political connections: PLA background
products: phones, 5G
cybersecurity: who owns the data? does huawei obligated to hand data over to government? (data sovereignty) 2017 National Intelligence Law: government has full access to data

consumer electronics: earn money
5G: losing money? early stage
R&D intensive, 45%, ranked 7th

Actions: Huawei CFO
hit money maker consumer electronics and undermine RD research (that might give China an edge)

Strategies
Defense: stop the other guy; Entity list
Offense: support/subsidize R&D
US 5G: Qualcomm

democratic: more effective in tech policies?
# Consequences
For US:
Rising prices, decrease consumption, higher saving rate -> less deficit

 
# Summary
China Tech: conglomerate structure -> data integration -> AI
US lacked a clear 5G strategy (no offensive strategy)

China options: 
should china proactively lower its tariffs?
signal intentions? benefit its own economy?

China import relative to GDP: very low
house hold consumption share of GDP: very low
GDP = I + C + export
I: already in dept
lower tariff: more consumption, lower savings rate
