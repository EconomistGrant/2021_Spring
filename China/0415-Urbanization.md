Urbanization and Economic Growth: hand in hand

# "Managed Hand"
Central Government: promotion rule, based on mayor's growth and statbility

City government: land, public investment, permit & subsidy (hukou system)

# Industrial Policies 
Comprehensive: five year plans, strategic plans
sector based: industry specific plans
place-based: industrial parks 工业园?

## 2025 Plan
electrical equipment, ...
approaches: government subsidies, tax, trade, JVs, foreign acquisitions

US response: tighten tech transfer to china, strengthen foreign investment review

## Differences of industrial policies between China and western countries
private or public driven
PPP Public-Private Partnership, governmnet relationship with the market
centralized political system, transfer thru central tax system (only 30% left in city)
land sale revenue: 50% of the revenue sometimes
constant plan instead of passive response to crisis in US

# Industril Parks: Growth engine and misallocation cost
designated area zoned for the purpose of industrial development
all over the world: middle east and asia
why china works out?
"managed hand" solve a **land assemby problem** and a **cross firm co-ordination** that allows cluster in a timely fashion

synergy between place fundamentals + place-based policies

## Data analysis
TFP: 22% for park, 11% for impact area
Heterogenety: 30# not working out

ghost cities

## Risks
over investment
spatial misallocation: picking winners, helping weak places, or playing politics
mis-prioritization: everyone likes high-tech

conditional logit model, park i in city j
DECISION_{i,j} = b1 GDPGROWTH_{i,j} + b2 GINICHANGE + b3 CONNECTION WITH LOCAL GOV

## Discussion
why china works? government look to top. GDP 

# Case: Gu'An New Industry City

Who should lead the new city development? Public, Private, or PP?

What were the major strategies that contributed to economic vibrancy of GuAn?

CFLP: specilize in building new cities

government and developer work together, huge in debt...
