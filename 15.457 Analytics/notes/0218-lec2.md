# Statistical Modelling, Inference, and Forecasting
Candle stick charts, technical analysis
technical analysis:
trend, local peaks are increasing

eyeballing: not reliable!

## Timing the market
form a view, by forecasting future returns
next-month return prediction: signal xt, price-dividend ratio


# Statistical Learning 
want to learn the conditional distribution of y from observed data

the true and unkown data-generating process(DGP)
y = f(x) + e

find $\hat{f}$ that is close to f: supervised learning
example: factor model for returns
omiting factors

## what is a good model
prediction error = y - \hat{y} = (f(x) - \hat{f}(x)) + e
MSE: mean squared error, emphasized big errors
MAE
