# Overview
Finance is going through major changes
new datasets, methods of analysis, computing

# What is quant investing?
Benjamin Graham: value investing
criteria: page 10

Time series: use information at time t to predict return at t+1
Cross section: after controlling factors, find alpha, long short strategies

how much predictability do we need?
sometimes is miserable, compared with AI recognition
coin flip: more flips -> small edge gonna scale up
Fundamental law of active investing: IR = IC * sqrt(Breadth)

# Challenge for finance analytics
1. where is your data from?
2. too big data: engineering and modelling, too big to run regression?
3. low sigal to noise ratio, observations not independent, non-stationary, measurement/selection/survivorship bias...

"the needle comes in an increasingly larger haystack": big data = more noise
correlation does not imply causality

randomnized controlled experiment

# What should you expect from this course
1. get your hands dirty, techniques for building
2. the grammer test after the black box, intuition based on a deep level of understanding of the theory
3. think big, bridge the gap between theory and practice
