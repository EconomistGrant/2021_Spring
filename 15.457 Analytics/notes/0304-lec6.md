# Goodness of FIt
R^2 = 1 - RSS/TSS \
adjusted R^2 = 1 - (RSS/n-p)/(TSS/n-1)
think about TSS as regress yi on a constant value

# Significance of coefficients
t statistic, n-p degree of freedom, beta_j/SE(beta_j)
F statistics: F = (TSS - RSS)/(p-1)  / RSS/(n-p) 

# Trouble shooting
## Multicollinearity
predicted variables are independent: run a sequence of regression = multilinear regression
multicollinearity: two or more predictors are closely related: accuracy, standard error

Vairance Inflation Factor: VIF(beta_j) = 1 / (1-R^2_{Xj|X-j}) 
regression on all other predictors: if very high -> redundant
variance of beta_j is "inflated" by VIF
VIF > 5/10: multicollinearity

Example: two variables (on your notes)

## Misspecification
1. ommision of relevant variable
   biased (proof on your note)
   E[b1|x] = beta_1 + inv(X1'X1)X1'X2beta_2

   for example, using size to "proxy" ability in pay regression: X1'X2 is positive(board doing good job);beta_2 is positive
   

2. inclusion of irrelevant variables
   unbiased but could inflate variance
   overfit
   "kiteching sinking regression"
