# Where are "events"
corporate: mergers, acquisitions, splits, news patents
macro: macro annoucements
policy: bank regulation, FDA decisioins, SEC rulings
Natural: weather, epidemic, climate

Efficient reaction, overreaction and underreaction

# Challenges:
seperate price reactions to news from other unrelated movements?
how to test for significanceï¼Ÿ

# Anatomy
1. event definition and event window
2. selection criteria for firms/secs (market friction prevent information: penny stocks, illiquid)
3. model/estimate "normal" returns - abnormal returns
4. hypotest and interprete
   
stock split
post earnings annoucement drift(PEAD): maintain the same momentum as pre-earning-announcement
Index inclusion

Estimation Window + Underlying model
use the model to predict normal return in event window: normal return, abnormal return

Null Hypothesis: event does not change the distribution of abnormal returns
mean 0
variance: second moment

star: event window
no star: estimation window
