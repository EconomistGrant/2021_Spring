1: topological sort, use DFS
a list mark

DFS(v):
    if done[v] == true: returns
    adjacents
    for u in adjacents:
        if done[u] is false: DFS(u)
    order.append(v)
    done[v] <- true
for v in V: DFS(v)




when you back

[1,2],[],[1],[1]

DFS:
node 0 
 node 1, done, append to the order list
 node 2, DFS of 1 is done, append to the order list
node 0, done



you can mark the point and as return of DFS function
mark = highest mark of adjacencies + 1
