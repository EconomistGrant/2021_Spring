(1) If uv is a bridge -> removing uv will increase the number of connected components

since u and v are originally connected at least by uv 
Denote A for the set of nodes connected to u or v, B for the set of nodes connected to neither u nor v

claim 1: a connected component can not have nodes from more than one of {A,B}
The proof is trivial, since any two nodes from different sets are not connected

As a result, the number of connected components for the whole graph is essentially the sum of number of connected components in A,B

claim 2: A only has one connected component
The proof is trivial as well since all nodes in A are connected to u or v, u and v are connected thus they are all connected
It is needless to prove that removing uv will not increase the number of connected componens from B. Now lets consider A.

We prove the contrapositive statement of the original question is: if there is at least one path from u to v that does not include uv, then uv is not a bridge
Removing uv wont affect other nodes' connection with u and v in A. As a result, all nodes in A are connected to u or v. If there is at least one path from u to v that does not include uv, u and v are still connected after removing uv; as a result, all nodes in A are still connected and there is still only one connected component in A. Removing uv sont increase the number of connected components so uv is not a bridge


(2) u and v are connected and edge uv is the only way for them to be connected. Without loss of generality, assume u is discovered earlier than v. Just when u is discovered, edge uv is undiscovered and node v is undiscovered. As a result, v is discovered through uv and uv is thus a tree edge

(3) u is parent of v, u.in > v.in, and you will backtrack from v to u

wx is a back edge and w is descendant of v
so for v's subtree, every time you find a back edge, you record what the back edge is pointing to, and find its discovery time

if u.in >= v.low, then there is a backedge in v's subtree that connects a v's decendant x to u or u's ascendant y. As a result, there is a another path from v to u apart from uv: v's tree edges to x, x's backedge to u directly or y and y's tree edges to u. This contradicts fact proved in (1). Thus u.in < v.low

(4) Run a DFS that updates v.low
DFS(u):
    u.in = in++
    u.low = u.in
    mark u as explored
    for v in u.adjacent_list:
        if not explored: DFS(v)
        u.low = min(u.low,v.low)
        if u.in < v.low: bridges.append(uv)

Runtime: every node is called by DFS once; every edge is accessed by the inner loop once. O(n+m)

(5) Run DFS as (4), while also maintain a list *in_order*that records the discovery order of nodes. *in_order[k]* is the node discovered at discovery time k

Design a iterating loop:
while v.low < v.in: v = v.low

This loop finds the earliest ancestor of v that can be found through back edges.
We firstly run the loop on t, say the loop ends at p. There are at least two paths from p to t, so Avert can always arrive at p and find at least two ways to t. Now the question degenerate into blocking path from s to p. Since there is no child of p1 that can go to earlier discovered node, block p and its parent can do the job: this is one possible street. 

Recurse the algorithm on s to p.parent, and end until p or p.parent == s

Correctness: proven in the algorithm.
runtime: the DFS takes O(n+m). Every iteration in the loop directs to an earlier discovered node, so the total runtime of iteration is bounded by O(n). The whole algorithm is bounded by O(n+m)
