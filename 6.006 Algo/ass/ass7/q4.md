1)
s1= 0, s2 = -4, s3 = -15, s4 = -7

2)
sum of LHS < 0

3) Use a node to represet an assignment. If there is constraint s_i - s_j <= e_ji, construct a edge from j to i with weight e_ji. 

4) Using the representation in part c, we run BF algorithm to either find "shortest distances" of all current nodes relative to node 1, which is also the earliest start time of assignment i relative to assignment 1.
As we can observe, s_i <= s_j + e_ji has the same structure as updating ("relaxing") the distance from s_j to origin in a graph. So during iteration, instead of updating "best estimate of shortest distance", we are updating the best estimate of earliest start time possible for assignment i.

If the BF algorithm finds an negative loop, then follow the same logic in (2), adding both the LHS and RHS we can not satisfy the restrictions. On the other direction, if there is a set of restrictions like (2), their is essentially a negative loop in the graph.

If the BF algorithm run successfully, then we have a choice of starting times since every updates satisfies the restrictions, and there does not exist a negative loop, so the correctness of the algorithm is proven. The runtime is essentialy the runtime of BF algorithm which is O(nm)
