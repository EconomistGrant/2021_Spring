# Polish National Flag
swaps to move red pegs left of all white 
find leftmost white...rightmost red...swap

left with the middle part, continue
essentially two pointers?

# Dutch National Flag Problem
Dijstra algo

everything left to the left pointer: red
everything right to the right pointer: blue

mid pointer: unknown, iterate
    if red, swap with left ptr, left ptr++
    if blue, swap with right ptr, right ptr++
    if white, mid ptr++
