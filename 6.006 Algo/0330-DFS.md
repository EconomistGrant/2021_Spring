physical interpretation: go out of a maze
go to museum, backtrack only when no way down

# Complexity
Per Edge:
1 marking, 2 traversals, 1 backtracking

Per Node:
1 number, 1 bringing CoA, 1 removing CoA

CoA is essentially the frame? the function on which node is called

# DFS Tree:
tree edge
back edge: leading to ancestor

# Directed DFS
traverse in the direction of edge
forward edge: not existent, because descendant will explore the edge first as back edge
cross edge: "unrelated" subtree

## Detected edge type
undiscoverd, unfinished, finished(before backtracking to its ancestor, mark as finished)

to undiscovered: back edge
to finished: cross edge(to earlier visited) or forward edge(to later visited)

# Good for
back edge -> cycle
