Hash tables are good: if yo uwant to find the key exactly
not good to find previous or next

# BST
Root: no parents
Leaf: no children

search, insert, find, findmin, deletemin(T)

## successor(x)
if x.right is not None: return find_min(x.right)
while x.parent and A is A.parent.right:
    A = A.parent
return A

//move A up until move right



Binary Tree
a tree of linked binary nodes containing:
- a pointer to the item stored at the node
- a pointer to the parent node
- a pointer to the left child
- a pointer to the right child

Traversal order:
every node in the left subtree of X comes before x in the traversal
every node in the right subtree of x comes after x in the traversal

insert B before A
Insert_before(A,B):
    if A.left:
        A = A.left.subtree_last()
    A.right = B
    B.parent = A


Delete a node
find precessor,swap,delete
If A.left: B = A.predecessor
If A.right: B = A.successor

Construct a binary tree that keeps the original order
store middle value as the root, recurse on each half...
H(n) = 2H(n/2) + 1
