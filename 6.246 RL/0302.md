# RL Researcg At Scale
impactful research: new axes of capability / understanding
How? What is the problem? impactful compared to what?

you can only learn by playing with it
three axis of algorithm: complexity, tasks, assumptions

## Making progress in ml research
problem - method-x - nearest neighbot - reporduce analysis - introduce change - evaluate

build on top of others
effective experimentation 

setting up python code base
manage hyper parameters

## Setting up a python codebase
__main__ module depends on entry points
local imports produces duplicates
work directory get injected to sys.modules
