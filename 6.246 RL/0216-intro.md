# DP
environment: stochsatic system, trainsition prob -- state -> feedback control policy -- decision/control -> system (environment)

RL: 
1. make sequence of decisions,
2. outcome not fully predictable but can be anticipated to some extent before the next decision is made
3. action affect future state

trade of between exploration and exploitation

Reinforcement learning is learning how to map states to actions so as to maximize a numerical reward signal in an unknown uncertain environment
agent discover which actions yield the most reward bt trying them

super-human performance in games: atari

# Atari vs Cat Recognition
Cat Recognition: a definite right answer
RL: not provided, no LABEL
reward is not the answer, just a value, can be higher or lower in future?
what is the right thing to choose? the core question of RL

# What in this course
1. how to model 
2. how to solve exactly
3. how to solve incrementally (from samples)
4. how to solve approximately

# Caution & oppurtunities
Under certainty
recent advances in machine learning
open source everything
ever-changing
think about new frontiers!
