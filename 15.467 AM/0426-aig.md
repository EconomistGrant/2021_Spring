# AIG
2006: balance sheet, 1 trillion, operating income 21.7 billion
2008: lost 99.3 billion

stock price: 2006: $110, 2007: $91, 2008: $2.64

Fed provided AIG credit line, bougth preferred interest in its subsidiaries
Treasury bought preferred stocks using Trouble Asset Relief Program
commitment to AIG was 182 billion

mid 2010: capital structure: mix of public and private interest 

# Peace Dividend
conflit between debt holders and equity holders could be resolved, result in increased enterprise value

AIG experts have knowledge but vested interest...
Fed also have interests...

# Solution
Risk-neutral distribution of equity prices implied from options
or using BSM, Merton's Jump Diffusion Model

different layers of capital structure: options
Common = JumpCall(Strike = Face(preferred + Senior + Junior + AIA\ ALICO + FRBNY))
Common + Preferred = JumpCall(Strike = Face(Senior + Junior + AIA \ ALICO + FRBNY ))
Common + Preferred + Junior = JumpCall(Strike = Face(Junior + AIA \ ALICO + FRBNY ))
Common + Preferred + Junior + Senior = JumpCall ( Strike = Face ( AIA\ALICO+FRBNY ))
Common + Preferred + Junior + Senior + AIA\ALICO = JumpCall(Strike = Face(FRBNY) 

u know all the face values, and now you want to calculate the values: bootstrap

# Risk neutral density
input: call option prices

# BSM model
reference price to get vol: equity, formular No.1
then calculate debt: the model gives higher price than the market price

# Jump-diffusion model
poisson process of jump

pick parameters to minimize weighted sum of bond price errors
asset value risk neutral distribution

refinement: use junior debt instead of senior debt as reference price

#TODO what does the curve mean? around 1 hour

# Proposal
government state consolidated
UST $15bn gain
