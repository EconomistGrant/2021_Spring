univeristy exists for:
- create knowledge, research
- distribute knowledge, education
- store knowledge

# Class 14: Challenges of Funding Retirement

## Retirement Goal
inflation proteced income for life, that allows to sustain the standard of living that you enjoyed in the latter part of your working life

## Only 4 ways to improve the probability of a good retirement
1. save more
2. work longer
3. take more investment risk
4. improve income benefits from accumulated retirement assets?

## 6 Components of a sustainable integrated approach
1. Social Security/defined benefit employer pension plan
employer bear the risk

2. Defined-Contribution
without requiring financial knowledge/literacy?
employee bears risk, can contribute
4f
3. for uncovered workers: expand oppurtunity, pension bond
4. more benefits from assets available at retirement
5. work longer, in a systematically organized, retirement friendly employement structure
designed jobs for seniors

6. Reconstructure the retirement system as a broader lifecycle crisis-coverarge system
quickly, efficiently during personal and systematica crisis

## Key DC design principles
replacement income as the goal for retirement: people understand stream of income
income shortfall, retirement income risk. use all dedicated retirement assets
recognize personalization
effectively even for those completely unengaged........
supply only meaningful info
scalable, low cost, payout flexibility

## DC: Key retirement income principle
display only account balance: most individuals have no way to relate balance to standard of living?
real income in current purchasing power

measure risk correctly: against inflation!

# Class 15: Challenges continued, and solution
## Funded Ratio
funded ratio: how much income lump sum buys / target income goal

Retirement-dedicated asset / (the value of annuity, protected from inflation)

higher funded ratio: strategy can be more conservative
(Target can be 60% replacement ratio...)
lifecycle theory: more conservative over time?

## Most polular and largest AUM: TDA
Target-Date Fund 

Pre-specified asset allocation path (glide path)

Customization of dynamic asset allocation

## Allocation based on Funded Ratio and Human Capital (FR/HC)
start with 160%,  or truncated at 100% 
mostly funded low HC
unfunded low HC, mostly funded high hc
unfunded high HC: most aggressive

## Conservative Income and Desired Income
DC assets available for conservative income level
DC assets available for desired income goal(seeks to maximize the probability of achieving the desire income goal)

# Class 16: Efficient use of retirement assets
Annuuities: guaranteed income benefit for as long as retiree lives
payout: higher than other interest rate, in return for giving up the assets at death

## Reverse Mortgage
no interest or principal payments until the retiree's death
Non-recourse loan: his beneficiary has the option to pay accumulated interest plus principal and retain ownership, or abandon the house without penalty (you can regard as selling the house and buy a call option?)

## Status Quo
no private sector
capped: relative, absolute

We observe: long-term reductions in employer-funded benefits
unlikely increses in social security
longer life expectancy

## No beneficiary or no bequest motive
should spend all the mortgage proceeds on a stream of additional income for life

## Retiree and beneficiary behavior
for retiree: 
dont care interest rate(-> residue value) on the mortgage
focus on getting high loan-to-value on a reverse mortgage? 

for beneficiary: receives immediate cash of the proceeds from the morgage, plus a call option
o/w no cash and a "lottery ticket", and teh lottery is not something beneficiary wants to happen

## Supply side: right risk holder, should not be opportunistic
much longer duration than ordinary mortgages

- senior debt tranche: no exposure to house asset price
for pension fund and insurers: hedge for their annuities nad pension liab
for mutual funds: long-duration, high quality, inflation-indexed fixed-income exposure

- equity tranche: 
asset class: residential housing
diversification

# Class 17: SeLFIES
Standard of Living indexed, Forward-starting, Income-only Securities
1. start date - annual level payouts - maturity date, length the same (bit longer than life expoectancy - standard retirement age)
2. indexed to aggregate per capita consumption
3. rated same as government bonds

sold at auction, traded in secondary market
issues/redeemed in small denominations directly

provisions for "aggregators"? support close correspondence between market and direct issue prices

## Example
28 age, retire at 65 (2058)
each 2058 SeLFIES has:
$10/year in 2058 for 20 years 

protects against inflation + standard of living until 2058?
only protect inflation after 2058(fixed standard of living)

>goal based: pretty simple calculation, no financial literacy
>average consumption growth = inflation growth + standard of living growth

compare with TIPS: reinvestment risk

## longevity risks: outliving assets
hedge on yourself!

frictionless world: competitive insurance companies! life annuity - same payments for SeLFIES, if maturity = life expectancy
friction world: the maturity of the SeLFIES should be set longer to cover the expected costs!

This is the risk-free asset! Will also be of institutional interest, or investors in general

## Why government:
no credit risk, reliable supplier, VAT as "natural" issuer as a tax on consumption
more domestic holding of government debt

market completion, infrastructure financing
