Lifecycle investing as a subset of AM, and Retirement Finance as a subset of Lifecycle investing

# SECTION 1 FUNDATIONS OF MODERN ASSET MANAGEMENT
# Lec 1 AM process, constructing the risk-free asset and calculating VaR
Asset Class Expected Returns
## Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
Capital Market Line
$Z_market, /sigma_market$ as the market portfolio

Security market line, individual stock, correlation with Market ~ expected return (CAPM)

## Manage Risk
Diversification, Hedging and Insurance
D & H are "free", insurance is not
insurance is gaining popularity

## Understand the sources of Alpha
know the comparative advantage you have
 
construct max sharpe:
1. passive benchmark market portfolio efficient diversification
2. active asset-class allocation, macro sector, market timing
3. superior performing micro aggregate excess return portfolio "alpha ENgines"

Optimal combinaiton of risky assets (max sharpe) + riskless asset -> optimal mean variance port
-> combine with state-variable hedging portfolio
-> alter shape of returns, dynamic portfolio strategies, derivatives, ...
-> structured efficient form of returns to the portfolio

no superior information: stick with passive!
if you have information on sectors/timing/macro/big components
alpha engines: arbitrage, techinical analysis, ...

The world portfolio is always an important component of optimal combination, even if you have alpha from a single security!

Frictionless, Myopic, risk-averse, mean-variance

Efficient Frontier, Capital Market Line tangent from Risk Free Rate

CAPM: E(Ri) = RFR + (E(R_MKT) - RFR) * beta + alpha, Security Market Line
beta = cov(Ri, R_MKT) / Var(R_MKT) = /rho (i, MKT) * sigma_i / sigma_MKT
Sharpe Ratio = (R_portfolio - RFR) / sigma, constant along SML

SML: individual securities, beta and return
CML: market, asset allocation, sigma and return

VaR(horizon, probablity)
