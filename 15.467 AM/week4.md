Evaluate in traditional way: bias?
missing assets in your calculation: not recorded on the balance sheet

# terminology
defnied pension plan: residual value to equity, liability to employees (after retirement)?

Defined Contribution: benefit according to accumulated value of funds in the account, bear investment risk
Defined Benefit plan: sponsor guarantees the plan and absorbs the investment risk

immunization: match every liability

# Effect of Pension Asset Risk Mismatch on Equity risk and COC
step 1: calculate operating asset beta from WACC?       ---1.05
step 2: Pension Assets(46) & Pension Liability()
using WACC, leverage is larger, beta of firm is smaller ---0.49

beta_pensionAssets: known in someway? is a policy?      ---0.6
beta_operatingAssets: total beta, beta_PA               ---0.36


pension asset beta = fraction of pension assets (invested) in "Equities"(SP500)?

# Do real world investors really cares?
rate declines since 2001: liability going up(present value, discouting), asset going down because of dot com crisis?

firm risk ~ pension risk: t-value 3.78

WACC adjusted for pension risks: reduced, 8.8% -> 6.1% for Boeing

# Risk of invest PA in equities
typical choise: 75% in equities 25% bonds? risk?

Derivative: total return equity swap for total return on bonds
(pay bond return, receive stock return)
75% equities + 25% bonds = 100% bonds + 75% swap


# Collateral from parent 
page 12: consolidation
parent's asset base guarantees subsidiary to be able to fund with low rate

There should be guarantee from PareCo: 
as assets|equity in SubCo, as equity|liability in PareCo

ROE for SubCo decreased substantially


# Effects of infrequent trading
with fewer trades in SP500: smaller beta, increaing alpha

control premium???49% to 51%

## lag
mark to market versus non trading accounting values are subject to time lages and smoothing
destroys correlations among asset returns
lag in PE, say a year, result in smaller beta as well

tracking portfolio of public companies

## Survival Bias
company's price get updated: a new financing round - good performing survivals

if you dont record losses until 9 years: IRR is lower!

## Real Estate
Real Estate Investment Trusts(REITS) vs DIrenct Investment in Commercial Real Estate Fund
Direct Investment: updated very infrequently? appraisal once a year?
if something is privately traded: track and evaluate smartly



# BMS Life Cycle Model
human capital in your asset allocation
1. estimate human capital by valueing future wage imcome as traded asset, risk chracteristics
2. compute total wealth
3. optimal level of spenting on consumption and leisure at time t
4. determine the optimal gross amount and proportion of total wealth to invest in risky asset 
5. estimate implicit exposure to risk embodied in his uncertain future wage?

Same risk preference ends up with different ratio of equity / financial wealth
risky future wages: you kind of determines total risky/riskless amount, and substract risky future wages to get risky financial investment
