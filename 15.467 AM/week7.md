# Long term riskless equities?
Stock outperform bonds/t-bills when the horizons being larger
1. US is an outcoming of drawing? Germany: bond outperforming stocks!
2. Probablity of shortfall is decreasing for longer horizon, but the put option is increasing? why? because the penalty is increasing actually

For pension fund: liability is dicounted using expected stock return (8%), which decrease the liability value
put premium: insurance that stock < bond, the premium going up dramatically
California: constitutional guaranteed, so should be discounted as risk-free rate!

Liability-shortfall guarantee cost as a function of time horizon: cost more if you want to guarantee longer horizon

ASSUME THEY ARE RIGHT: LONG TERM, EQUITY RETURN FOR SURE
long enough horizon: earn for 8%, borrow for 3%
US government borrow for $ 1billion, invest in stock
excess value created: ......
everything human problem is solved

# Invest only in what you know about?
you can have the alpha but lose the diversification
right way: mix your portfolio with world portfolio
*Investing in what you know: the case of individual investors and local stocks*

# Time Diversification vs. Across-Securities Diversification
time diversification: half the time 100% risky, half the time 100% risk free: var = 0.5  sigma^2 T
across-sec diversification: 50% in risky, 50% in risk free:                   var = 0.25 sigma^2 T

time div: same expected return, double volatility
