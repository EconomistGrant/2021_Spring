replacement income as the goal for retirement
income shortfall, retirement income risk. use all dedicated retirement assets
recognize personalization
effectively even for those completely unengaged........
supply only meaningful info
scalable, low cost, payout flexibility

# DC: Key retirement income principle
display only account balance: most individuals have no way to relate balance to standard of living?
real income in current purchasing power

measure risk correctly: against inflation!

# Funded Ratio
funded ratio: how muich income lump sum buys / target income goal
Retirement-dedicated asset / (the value of annuity, protected from inflation)

higher funded ratio: more conservative
(Target can be 60% replacement ratio...)
lifecycle theory: more conservative over time?

# Allocation based on Funded Ratio and Human Capital (FR/HC)

mostly funded low HC
unfunded low HC, mostly funded high hc
unfunded high HC: most aggressive
