# Implied Volatiliy
linear to option price?
VIX over time: 3/16/2020 historical high
term structure VIX: longer horizons
normal: upward sloping, Dec 31/2019
flat, Jan 31/2020
Downward, Feb 28/2020

volatility might be resolved in a bad way...the market is down and done!
similar in 2008: upward in august, downward in november - march 2009

VSTOXX: IV for eu equities
TYVIX: treasury note volatility price index

## Computation: changing volatility in BSM
average volatility? plug into BSM???

## variances in volatlity
realized volatility is also changing very fast
VIX: expected

trade realization vs. VIX
variance swap

VIX futures volume: explode since 2012

# Jump diffusion model
jump/gap in the path?
change of the character of the option: extreme out/in the money option becomes more valuable

volatility smile: higher vol at ends
smirk: one side, market guess in the direction of jump

Jump-DIffusion model explains

# expected return based on vol
alpha - r = Y*g(sigma)
Y: reward to risk ratio

digital option -> probability, distribution
implied "probability" of interest rate range
you dont need to assume log normal or any model, and can end up with a distribution!
